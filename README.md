A space where I code, learn, and build cool things

Welcome to `code-catalyst` — my personal repository for practicing **Java** and **Python**, solving problems, and building projects that help me grow as a developer. I'm currently in **Grade 11**, and my goal is to use this space to sharpen my coding skills and create an impressive portfolio by the end of Grade 12.
